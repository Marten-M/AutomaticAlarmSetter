# Automatic Alarm Setter app
Android app that allows an alarm to ring a specified time after the screen is turned off. Tested only on Android 12 and does not work with Android 14 onwards. 
This is a simple Android project I made to learn the basics of Android development and Java. It is by no means implemented well and a lot of things should be done differently
to make it work on newer versions of Android. UI could also be improved greatly, as it currently does not look very appealing.

Project can be cloned and opened in Android Studio directly.
